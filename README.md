# Hello-World
Starting fresh and starting strong


I'm learning as quickly as I can to make sure I"m up to smack with the demands of the new company I want to work for, Snap. I believe in the company and I want to do what's best for me and for the company, as they are delivering valuable products to the world that allows users to express themselves freely and that's a great method to build character and personality.
